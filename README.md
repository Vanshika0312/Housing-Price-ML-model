Housing Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate regression models that can accurately predict house prices. By using a dataset of housing information, the model learns patterns and provides insights into key factors affecting property value.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Feature engineering & scaling
Model training with multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²
Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
Predictions on test/unseen data
